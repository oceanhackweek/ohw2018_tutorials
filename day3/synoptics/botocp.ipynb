    "#\n",
    "# The boto package is the hand-coded Python library that has been around \n",
    "# since 2006. It is very popular and is fully supported by AWS but because \n",
    "# it is hand-coded and there are so many services available (with more \n",
    "# appearing all the time) it is difficult to maintain.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# So, boto3 is a new version of the boto library based on botocore. All \n",
    "# of the low-level interfaces to AWS are driven from JSON service descriptions \n",
    "# that are generated automatically from the canonical descriptions of the services. \n",
    "# So, the interfaces are always correct and always up to date. There is a \n",
    "# resource layer on top of the client-layer that provides a nicer, more Pythonic interface.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The boto3 library is being actively developed by AWS and is the one I would \n",
    "# recommend people use if they are starting new development."
